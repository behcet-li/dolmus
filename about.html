<h2>About dolm.us</h2>
<br/>
<p>This website is what is that dry cleaner on your street to your neighbourhood
drug cartel. Just a storefront with neon lights, which you probably passed by
countless times before without even noticing its existence, let alone going
inside once.</p>
<h3>What's going on here ?</h3>
<p>This started when I needed a domain and ended up with <i>dolm.us</i>.</p>
<p>I decided to build a website for the domain I already had during a very boring
cold snap and evidently I could not come up with any meaningful copy.</p>
